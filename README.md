# System Design Algorithms

This repo has only one mission: to save my implementations in [Go Language](https://go.dev/) for important algorithms correlated about system design (I'm currently studing both). System Design has no direclty algorithms of course, but some important topics do.

## These are the topics studied (so far)

### Rate Limit Algorithms
- Token Bucket
